# Android/Wear M0 Apple persistence fixture evidence

Status: **M0 format and hosted-CI audit complete — physical-device/account gates remain external**

The committed corpus is under `Packages/VoxboardShared/Tests/Fixtures/Persistence/v1/`.
Its `manifest.json` records `b50167a` only as the planning parent and records deterministic codec revision
`6d453e7c4cc60fda0fb2cb9d9399c8d92873b7d0` as the producer. It also records the generator path/SHA-256, fixed synthetic provenance,
and a SHA-256 plus byte count for every file. CI validates committed bytes; it never
regenerates them first.

## Executable production-codec coverage

| Surface | Production consumer/producer | Fixture evidence | Executed behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capture library | `CaptureLibraryStore` | `capture-library/` and `negative/capture-library/` | Store-driven production/current encode-decode, bookmark `Data`, future-version rejection, malformed base64 rejection |
| Draft and prepared request | `CaptureDraftStore` | `drafts/` and `negative/drafts/` | Store-driven draft and prepared-request production/current encode-decode plus missing required ID rejection |
| Capture inbox tombstone | `CaptureInbox.enqueue`, `claim`, `complete`, and `requestIDs` | `inbox/` and `negative/inbox/` | Tombstone is produced by the private production codec; current decode and future receipt sanitization are executed |
| Capture history | `CaptureHistoryStore.writeCompatibilityFixture` and `load` | `history/` and `negative/history/` | Private production envelope encode/decode and future file-version rejection |
| Recording job/handoff | `RecordingJobStore`, `RecordingJob`, `RecordingJobHandoffIntent` | `recording-jobs/job-v1.json`, `handoff-v1.json`, negative job, `recording-jobs/checkpoints/`, delivery receipt bytes, and `recording-jobs/recovery/` | Production-store transcript/audio/note/reference checkpoints, complete future-version rejection, delivery marker bytes, and recovery of interrupted processing/finalizing, missing audio, completed deleted audio, and orphan audio |
| External delivery transaction | `ExternalFileDeliveryTransaction` private journal codec | `recording-jobs/delivery-journals/{note,audio,noteAudioReference}/` | Production `{version,targetPath,preimage,postimage}` journals and payloads for every artifact role; missing/existing preimages and SHA-256 postimages verified by the private production implementation |
| Capture usage | `CaptureDeliveryUsageStore.reserve`, `commit`, and `snapshot` | `usage/capture-usage-v1.json` | Private production ledger is generated and consumed through the actor store |
| Keyboard IPC | Public `Transcription*`, `Recording*`, `ListeningState`, and live-transcription codecs | `keyboard-ipc/` | Every committed JSON file is decoded and semantically checked; raw `Float`, pending text, and retained audio bytes are exact-checked |
| Transcript, activity, origin, live state | `TranscriptStore`, `ActivityStatsStore`, `CaptureRecordingOriginStore`, and live-state codec | `transcripts/`, `stats/`, `recording-origin/`, `live-state/` | Store-driven producer/consumer validation for the first three and current semantic live-state decode |
| Foundation wire | `JSONEncoder` / `JSONDecoder` defaults | all JSON fixtures | Date reference epoch, base64 `Data`, UUID strings, and raw enum strings are asserted |

`VoxboardPersistenceFixtures --validate` also requires an exact manifest/file-set
match, validates every SHA-256, executes every current negative fixture, and scans
textual fixtures for machine/user path or App Group leakage.

## App-hosted Watch fixture coverage

`VoxboardTests/AndroidWearM0PersistenceFixtureTests.swift` executes the committed
Watch inbox and property-list bytes against app-target production models, stores,
and key catalogs. It covers current/legacy/malformed `WatchRecordingInboxItem`,
production index/sidecar/tombstone and orphan recovery, current and legacy-minimal
XML/binary application contexts, current/legacy/incompatible file
metadata including preset/location payloads, and committed property lists for every
current command and preset response outcome.

## Watch-target fixture coverage

`Voxboard Watch Tests/AndroidWearM0WatchPersistenceFixtureTests.swift` consumes the
committed current/legacy application contexts through `WatchRecordingSnapshot`,
freezes the Watch-local snapshot dictionary round trip, executes confirmed and pending preset stores including malformed data and `Int64.max`
sequence rollover, and drives the production Watch queue store through legacy, active,
orphan, and corrupt-index recovery on a watchOS simulator.

## UserDefaults fixture coverage

`settings/allowlisted-settings-v1.json` is produced by isolated `UserDefaults`
through `CapturePresetStore`, `RecordingQueuePreferences`, `UsageTracker`,
`ModelManager`, and the package-owned onboarding analytics stores, then reloaded
through the same production consumers. App-hosted tests additionally load the
committed toolbar bytes through `CaptureToolbarPreferences`, execute review and quote
state, and Watch-target tests consume the committed preset/defaults corpus. The
87-key inventory is broader than this main snapshot: completion/migration markers,
Watch controller state, transport failures, and executable absent/default/invalid
cases also live in focused package, app-hosted, and Watch tests. Source-inventory
completeness remains distinct from committed fixture completeness.

The Watch tests exercise committed confirmed/pending preset bytes,
current/legacy/active/orphan queue layouts, the production local snapshot store,
partial and wrong-type dictionaries, unknown fields/enums, corrupt-index backup,
unsafe queue filename rejection, transfer failure/retry/upload, stale remote updates,
and terminal/duplicate acknowledgement replay. Real storage pressure remains an
explicitly external physical-device gate and is not claimed by codec tests.

## Outstanding compatibility matrix

`docs/architecture/android-wear-m0-compatibility-matrix.json` is the executable
format-by-dimension audit. It covers every `cap.store.*` capability and requires
each format to classify old/missing/unknown/malformed/future, Foundation wire
facts, and crash/recovery as `executed`, `notApplicable`, `pending`, or `external`,
with production symbols, evidence paths, and rationale. The repository validator
rejects omitted dimensions, unresolved production symbols, missing evidence, and
unmapped persisted-store capabilities.

The M0 requirement is a dimension audit, not a demand for nonsensical variants of
every byte stream. All 300 cells (30 formats × 10 dimensions) are explicitly
classified. No cell remains `pending` or `external`. The keyboard uses the tested shared
persist-before-insert/restart reducer, and Watch terminal replay executes the
production save-before-delete queue/audio transition and durable reload. Applicable
cells are `executed`; inapplicable behavior has a production-format rationale.

The M0 implementation and deterministic-codec commits exist. A clean local clone of
the attested implementation passed project contracts, fixture validation, and all
Swift package tests without modifying tracked files. Hosted Apple CI subsequently
passed all five jobs at `c173f3b90a03a1d11f563a7a2ddb9682f9ceb0c7` in
[run 31673674485](https://github.com/CodyBontecou/vox.md/actions/runs/31673674485),
using Xcode 26.6 and Swift 6.3.3. Physical-device/account gates remain external.
Passing the matrix validator or simulator CI must not be reported as physical-device
parity.

## Provenance and regeneration

- Planning parent (not the fixture-producing revision): `b50167aebb959e394908af3a5949f43fa88d6265`.
- Fixture-producing deterministic codec revision: `6d453e7c4cc60fda0fb2cb9d9399c8d92873b7d0`; the manifest generator SHA-256 attests the final source including this record.
- Generator source: `Packages/VoxboardShared/Sources/VoxboardPersistenceFixtures/main.swift`.
- Validation command:
  `swift run --package-path Packages/VoxboardShared VoxboardPersistenceFixtures --validate`.
- Intentional regeneration command:
  `swift run --package-path Packages/VoxboardShared VoxboardPersistenceFixtures --generate`.

A fixture change requires reviewing the byte diff and manifest SHA-256 diff;
regeneration is not a compatibility test by itself.
