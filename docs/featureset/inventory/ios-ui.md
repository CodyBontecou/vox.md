### F-IU-01 Root capture-first navigation (no tab bar)
- Surface: App root (`RootView`); all secondary screens pushed onto NavigationStack
- Summary: The Markdown capture composer is the app's root screen. There is no tab bar or sidebar; History, Settings, Models, Capture Presets, and App Language are pushed as secondary destinations, each reachable from the composer's action bar or Settings rows. Widget/keyboard launch pendings force navigation back to capture.
- Details:
  - `RootDestination` enum: `.capture`, `.history`, `.settings`, `.models`, `.capturePresets`, `.appLanguage` (RootView.swift:10-18)
  - `secondaryDestinationIsPresented` pops back to capture when dismissed (RootView.swift:84-89)
  - `pendingWidgetRecord` / `pendingKeyboardLaunch` onChange forces `.capture` (RootView.swift:48-56)
  - DEBUG-only localization screenshot story routing via `--localization-screenshot` launch argument mapping stories (`02-history`, `03-settings`, `04-models`, `05-capture-presets`, `06-privacy-local`, `07-keyboard`, `08-app-language`, `09-app-language-row`) to destinations (RootView.swift:20-37)
- Constraints: none beyond DEBUG gating of screenshot routing
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/RootView.swift` (lines 9-102)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-02 Quick Capture composer (root screen)
- Surface: `QuickCaptureView` — app root; Markdown text editor
- Summary: A raw-Markdown `UITextView` composer where captures are typed. Shows a blinking caret when empty and unfocused and keeps an inspiration quote (ZenQuotes API) visible regardless of the selected preset or attachments until text is inserted. Persists a durable draft on every change and auto-focuses the composer on first load unless release notes are being shown or a modal is up.
- Details:
  - Composer is a `MarkdownComposerTextView` (GeistMono 16pt, Dynamic Type scaling, autocorrection+spellcheck ON, smart quotes/dashes/insert OFF, interactive keyboard dismiss) — QuickCaptureView.swift:1602-1620, MarkdownComposerTextView.swift:94-125
  - Draft autosave on changes to text, voxID, destinationID, entryTemplateID, placementOverride, relativeNotePathOverride (QuickCaptureView.swift:300-320)
  - Blinking caret overlay when empty & unfocused; respects Reduce Motion (530 ms blink) (QuickCaptureView.swift:2276-2305)
  - Inspiration placeholder: ZenQuotes quote with attribution link to zenquotes.io whenever the draft text is empty; preset selection and attachment-only drafts do not displace it (QuickCaptureView.swift)
  - "Capture Sent" toast after successful submit, 2 s, VoiceOver announced (QuickCaptureView.swift:1805-1813, presentSentToast 1502)
  - Background-scene draft save with `beginBackgroundTask` (handleScenePhaseChange 1423-1437)
  - Initial composer focus task with 180 ms delay, skipped if any capture modal is presented (fulfillInitialComposerFocusIfReady 1415-1448)
- Constraints: focus deferral while release-notes sheet is up (environment `defersCaptureInputFocusForReleaseNotes`)
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 74-2311); `Voxboard/Capture/MarkdownComposerTextView.swift` (all)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-03 Capture Preset selection row
- Surface: Bottom control stack on Quick Capture
- Summary: A menu listing all enabled presets (falls back to defaults when none enabled) with symbol icons, plus a destination/route button showing the effective destination name or override path. An "Override" chip and reset button appear when a per-capture route override is active.
- Details:
  - Preset menu (`capture_vox_selector`), selection syncs Watch state via `WatchRecordingController.publishState()` (QuickCaptureView.swift:1245-1279, selectFlow 1730)
  - Route button label: override filename or destination rootName or "Set up destination" (routeLabel 1400-1405)
  - "Use Preset destination defaults" reset button when `hasAnyRouteOverride` (1272-1279)

  - Send button: label "Sending capture" while submitting; disabled & 35% opacity when `!canSubmit` or blocked by media/recording/transcribing (`quick_capture_submit`) (1393-1407; captureSubmissionIsBlocked 1393)
  - Keyboard toggle button flips composer focus (1408-1415)
- Constraints: capture submission requires unlock when `usageTracker.isCaptureAtLimit && draft.deliveryKind == .standard`
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 1355-1420, 1389-1396)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-05 Voice capture button (tap / long-press)
- Surface: Bottom action bar mic button on Quick Capture
- Summary: Single button that starts an inline recording (tap) or opens the detailed recording controls bar (long-press ≥0.45 s). While recording it shows elapsed time, a 7-bar live waveform (100 ms level updates via `TranscriptionIPC.readAudioLevel()`), and a red stop icon.
- Details:
  - Tap while recording always stops, even during unrelated media processing (handleVoiceCaptureTap 923-931)
  - Accessibility: label reflects state ("Stop voice recording, m:ss" / "Transcribing voice capture, N% complete" / "Unlock voice capture" / start hints); custom action "Show detailed recording controls" (557-586)
  - Dimmed to 35% opacity while media processing (586)

- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 506-586, 923-931, 1687-1705, 2299-2311)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-06 Detailed recording controls bar
- Surface: Expanding panel above the capture controls (`showsVoiceCaptureDetails`)
- Summary: Long-pressing the mic opens a panel with a status header (Recording / Transcribing % / Keyboard Listening On / Voice Capture), a Record/Stop primary button, a segmented mode picker ("Add to Draft" vs "Send Immediately"), preset menu, audio-attach toggle, audio file import, keyboard-listening toggle, usage meter, transcription result row with Copy, and speaker-diarization skip-reason warning.
- Details:
  - Segmented `Recording result` picker (`capture_recording_mode`) maps to `RecordingCompletionMode.captureDraft(attachAudio:)` or `.runVox(flowID:)` (625-630, 1669-1680)
  - "Attach audio to Capture" switch only in Draft mode (640-649)
  - "Import audio" button opens audio/movie fileImporter; import respects usage limit → paywall `.recording` (653-663, handleAudioImport 1742-1759)
  - Keyboard listening toggle: `capture_keyboard_listening`; stops set `autoListenEnabledKey=false` (665-676, togglePersistentListening 1707)

- Status: shipped

### F-IU-07 In-editor live transcription
- Surface: The editable Quick Capture composer while an in-app recording is active
- Summary: Finalized and tentative Apple Speech text appears directly in the Markdown editor for both "Add to Draft" and direct in-app "Send Immediately" recordings. The editor follows the transcript tail unless the user is actively editing elsewhere.
- Details: There is no separate transcript banner or four-line truncation. Draft mode commits the final text in place; Send Immediately keeps the preview memory-only and removes it after the independent Preset handoff, preserving any text the user had already typed.
- Constraints: Automatic backend on supported iOS versions; external Watch, widget, Shortcut, Live Activity, and keyboard recordings never rewrite the open composer.
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (`followLiveTranscriptTail`); `Voxboard/Capture/QuickCaptureCanvas.swift`; `Voxboard/PersistentRecorder.swift` (`previewsLiveTranscriptInComposer`)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-08 Keyboard listening (return guidance & status)
- Surface: Quick Capture nav bar trailing button, detail bar toggle, and top banner
- Summary: Enables the shared keyboard-extension voice pipeline. When the keyboard launches Vox.md (pendingKeyboardLaunch), a dismissible banner guides the user: "Turning on keyboard listening" → "Keyboard listening is on" / error with mic-access hint; auto-dismisses after 6 s. Nav-bar headphones button stops listening when active.
- Details:
  - `KeyboardLaunchPhase`: starting/ready/error with distinct icons/colors; blue info vs red error styling (733-796)
  - `handleKeyboardLaunch` prepares backend, posts accessibility announcements, tracks OnboardingAnalytics keyboard setup started/completed (1726-1741)
  - Nav bar stop button visible when `persistentRecorder.isListening && autoListenEnabledKey` (229-243)
- Constraints: requires microphone access; DEBUG screenshot story can pre-open details
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 214-243, 459-467, 733-796, 1707-1741, 1775-1803)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-09 Photo / screenshot attachment pickers
- Surface: Editor toolbar Add Media menu (Photo, Screenshot)
- Summary: Two PhotosUI pickers (images vs screenshots), each limited to 10 selections, staging picked images as draft payloads. Opted-in Capture Presets describe staged images on device before Send so generated labels appear in the attachment strip; screenshots start with localized placeholder alt text "Screenshot" until replaced. Filenames are `photo-<uuid>.<ext>` / `screenshot-<uuid>.<ext>`.
- Details: `.photosPicker` modifiers (607-625); `importPhotos`/`importScreenshots` stage via `viewModel.stageImage`, set `isProcessingMedia`, refocus composer on completion, per-item error surfacing (1520-1570)
- Constraints: max 10 per batch; media processing blocks recording start and send
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 607-625, 1520-1570)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-10 Camera capture
- Surface: Editor toolbar Add Media → Camera
- Summary: Presents `UIImagePickerController` (camera, falls back to photo library when camera unavailable), captures a JPEG at 0.9 quality, and stages it as `camera-<yyyyMMdd-HHmmss>.jpg`.
- Details: cancel refocuses composer; capture sets `isProcessingMedia` during staging (641-654, MultimodalCaptureViews.swift:58-92)
- Constraints: device camera availability

- Status: shipped

### F-IU-11 File attachment importer
- Surface: Editor toolbar "Add files" button
- Summary: Presents a native UIKit document picker (`UIDocumentPickerViewController`, `.data` content types, multiple selection, copy mode — chosen over SwiftUI fileImporter for on-device reliability) and stages files; images embed as images, audio embeds as audio, others as generic files.
- Details: respects `CaptureInputBudget` shared-item reservation; cancel refocuses composer (627-640, importFiles 1571-1592; MultimodalCaptureViews.swift:9-56)
- Constraints: staged files share the `CaptureInputBudget` shared-item reservation; otherwise none beyond platform minimums
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 627-640, 1571-1592); `Voxboard/Capture/MultimodalCaptureViews.swift` (lines 9-56)

### F-IU-13 Journal page capture & OCR (Capture Text)
- Surface: Editor toolbar "Extract text" menu → "Capture Journal Pages" / "Choose Journal Photos"
- Summary: Manual multi-page camera capture (native shutter only, avoiding VisionKit auto-capture) up to 10 pages, or ordered photo selection, followed by on-device Vision OCR (accurate, language correction, automatic language detection, unreadable page → hard error) that appends recognized Markdown text directly into the composer.
- Details:
  - Manual journal sheet: thumbnail strip with numbered pages, page counter (a11y id `journal_capture_page_count`), "Capture Page/Next Page", "Remove Last Page", "Use Pages" disabled when empty, auto-presents camera on open, VoiceOver "Page N captured" announcements (MultimodalCaptureViews.swift:126-251)
  - "Extracting text on this device…" progress banner with `capture_ocr_progress` id (QuickCaptureView.swift:161-174)
  - OCR blocked while any voice capture/transcription/watch processing is active — error "Finish the current voice capture before extracting journal text." (`requireIdleVoiceCaptureForOCR` 933-945); re-checked before appending so Watch delivery can't merge transcripts into one draft (extractJournalText 1640-1655)
  - `JournalImageOCRProcessorError`: noImages / unreadableImage(page) / noTextRecognized with photography guidance (MultimodalCaptureViews.swift:252-260)

- Details:
  - "Add" exports `drawing.dataRepresentation()` plus a 2x PNG via `drawing.image(from:scale: 2)` using `drawing.bounds.insetBy(dx: -24, dy: -24)` or a default 1024x768 rect when empty; disabled while `drawing.strokes.isEmpty` (MultimodalCaptureViews.swift `CaptureSketchEditor`)
  - Canvas: `PKCanvasView` with default `PKInkingTool(.pen, color: .black, width: 4)`, `drawingPolicy = .anyInput`, a visible `PKToolPicker` with the canvas made first responder; drawing synced through `PKCanvasViewDelegate` (`PencilCanvas`)
  - Saving sets `isProcessingMedia` while `viewModel.stageSketch` runs, then refocuses the composer; cancel dismisses and refocuses (QuickCaptureView.swift sketch sheet)
- Constraints: `drawingPolicy = .anyInput` supports finger + pencil
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 693-707); `Voxboard/Capture/MultimodalCaptureViews.swift` (lines 385-461)

  - `FileExportToastView` button shows "Export Ready" + filename + "Open File"; tap calls `openExportedFileInFiles`, which security-scopes the URL, opens it via `UIApplication.open`, and falls back to opening its folder (QuickCaptureView.swift:2252-2266, 2355-2375)
  - Auto-dismisses after 3.5 s; export failures rewrite `persistentRecorder.lastError` to "Your transcript was saved locally, but file export failed. …"
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 212-229, 1761-1770, 2199-2230)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-57 Quick Record widget / pending-launch consumption
- Surface: Background of Quick Capture (no dedicated UI)
- Summary: When the Lock Screen Quick Record control/widget launches the app (`pendingWidgetRecord`), the app resolves the requested preset (explicit or default via `WidgetRecordingFlowSelection`), selects it, and immediately starts a Send-Immediately one-shot recording with `.quickRecord` origin. Keyboard launches instead show the listening guidance banner.
- Details:
  - `consumePendingWidgetRecordIfNeeded` clears the flag, reads and removes `pendingWidgetRecordFlowIdKey`, resolves `WidgetRecordingFlowSelection`, selects an explicitly requested preset, forces `lastStartedRecordingMode = .preset`, clears `lastTranscriptionResult`, and starts `persistentRecorder.startOneShotInAppSegment(... completionMode: .runVox(flowID:), origin: .quickRecord)` (QuickCaptureView.swift:2199-2217)
  - Triggered by onChange of `pendingWidgetRecord` (QuickCaptureView.swift:333-336)
- Constraints: gated by `AppConstants.lockScreenQuickRecordEnabled`
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 348-357, 1787-1801); tests `WidgetRecordingFlowSelectionTests.swift`
- Status: gated (settings toggle)

### F-IU-58 Requested-input deep links (CaptureRequestedInput)
- Surface: Quick Capture presentation logic
- Summary: External requests (photos/screenshots/camera/files/scan/sketch/link/voice) auto-present the matching input surface when the app opens; voice requests switch recording mode to Add-to-Draft and start inline recording immediately.
- Details:
  - `presentRequestedInput` maps photos/screenshots/camera to their pickers, files to the document importer, scan to the VisionKit scanner only when `VNDocumentCameraViewController.isSupported`, sketch/link to their sheets, and voice to `.draft` recording mode plus `startInlineRecording()` (QuickCaptureView.swift:1761-1777)
  - Consumed both on initial load (`loadAndPresentRequestedInput`) and on `handleRequestedInputChange`; the requested input is cleared after presenting (QuickCaptureView.swift:1739-1760, 1609-1613)
- Constraints: scan deep link requires VisionKit document-camera support; camera deep link requires a camera; otherwise none beyond platform minimums
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 333-336, 1450-1500)
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-59 OCR progress & accessibility announcements
- Surface: Quick Capture OCR banner; VoiceOver across capture flows
- Summary: Broad accessibility support: error message announcements, "Capture sent", "Transcript added to Capture", "Extracting text on this device", "Extracted text added to Capture", journal page-count announcements, mic-level speech/quiet values, waveform accessibility-hidden, combined labels on status bars. OCR shows a dedicated progress banner row under the nav bar.
- Details:
  - OCR banner row under the nav bar: small ProgressView + "Extracting text on this device…", a11y id `capture_ocr_progress`, hidden during DEBUG localization screenshots (QuickCaptureView.swift:161-173)
  - Announcements posted via `UIAccessibility.post`: error messages, "Capture sent", "Transcript added to Capture"; the waveform view is marked accessibility-hidden
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 161-174, 326-329, 1502-1518, 1539-1655); `QuickCaptureVoiceViews.swift`; `MultimodalCaptureViews.swift`
- Status: shipped

### F-IU-60 Release-notes focus deferral
- Surface: Quick Capture composer focus
- Summary: When release notes are presented on launch, initial composer auto-focus is deferred (composer dismissed) until deferral ends; focus task id includes the deferral flag.
- Details:
  - Composer-focus task id `InitialComposerFocusTaskID` includes `defersCaptureInputFocusForReleaseNotes`; when deferral becomes true the composer is dismissed via `dismissComposer()` (QuickCaptureView.swift `draftLifecycleContent`)
  - `fulfillInitialComposerFocusIfReady` bails while the flag is set, so initial focus is only attempted after the release-notes sheet ends
- Constraints: active only when a release-notes sheet is presented at launch; otherwise none beyond platform minimums
- Evidence: `Voxboard/Views/QuickCaptureView.swift` (lines 274-298, 1401-1413); tests `ReleaseNotesPresentationTests.swift`
- Status: shipped

## Uncertainties
- `CaptureToolbarSettingsView` (Capture Bar customization UI, F-IU-30) and `RecordingQueueView` (Settings → Recording Queue) live outside the in-scope directories; only their entry points and preference model interactions are inventoried.
- `QuickCaptureVoiceView`/`QuickCaptureVoiceSession` appear to be an attach-voice-note flow whose presenter was not found in the in-scope files; it may be invoked from code outside scope (possibly legacy or share-extension flows). Status labeled "shipped" for the components themselves; primary in-app voice capture is the inline recorder.
- Exact contents of `CaptureToolbarAction` ordering/defaults live in shared code (`VoxboardShared`), not read here; only the command dispatch and visible-actions mechanism were verified.
- `AppLanguage` supported-language list not enumerated (defined in shared code).
- Which surfaces present `QuickCaptureVoiceView` (e.g., a voice-attachment entry point removed from the current toolbar) could not be confirmed from the in-scope files.
