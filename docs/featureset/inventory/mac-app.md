# Vox.md (Voxboard) Mac App — Feature Inventory

Scope: every feature verifiable in `Voxboard Mac/` (13 Swift files, ~11,617 lines). Shared types referenced here (e.g. `QuickCaptureViewModel`, `CapturePresetStore`, `RecordingJobQueue`, `AppConstants`, `FoundationModelsBackend`) live in `VoxboardShared` and are cited as dependencies only.

Main-window destinations in `MacRootView` are grouped as **Work** — Capture, Recording Queue, History — and **Configure** — Transcription Models, Capture Presets, Entry Templates. App preferences use the separate native Settings scene.

---

### F-MC-01 Main Navigation Window (Work / Configure)
- Surface: `VoxboardMacApp` `WindowGroup(id: "main")` → `MacRootView`
- Summary: A `NavigationSplitView` app with persistent Work and Configure sidebar sections. Each window owns an observable `MacNavigationState`; external commands route a typed `MacMainWindowRequest.navigate` through `MacWindowCoordinator`.
- Details:
  - Work destinations: Capture (`square.and.pencil`), Recording Queue (`waveform.circle`), History (`clock.arrow.circlepath`). Configure destinations: Transcription Models (`cpu`), Capture Presets (`slider.horizontal.3`), Entry Templates (`doc.badge.plus`). Column width 150/180/220, min window 980×680.
  - Detail routing: `MacCaptureWorkspaceView`, `RecordingQueueView` (retry with selected/fallback model, selected language, delivery override; recovery presets from `CapturePresetStore.loadFlows()`), persistent `MacHistoryView` list/detail, `MacModelView`, `MacCapturePresetSettingsView`, and `MacEntryTemplateLibraryView`.
  - Settings is not a main destination. Capture's gear control invokes SwiftUI's native `openSettings` action and the app retains one `Settings` scene.
  - Capture model-error recovery selects `.models` in the same window; Models has no app-authored sheet presentation.
  - `.macNavigate` carries a typed `MacNavigationRequest` with destination and window token. Capture focus/input delivery stays pending until the selected token's workspace finishes `await viewModel.load()` and destructive draft restoration; `.macShowCapture`, `.macChooseCaptureFiles`, and `.macClearCaptureDraft` require matching typed tokens and reject nil/untyped payloads.
  - DEBUG-only: `--localization-screenshot <story>` preselects History, Models, or Capture Presets; Settings still swaps the detail for its dedicated screenshot story. `MacLocalizationScreenshotRoot` renders full surfaces without the vibrancy sidebar.
- Constraints: screenshot story handling compiled only `#if DEBUG`.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` (`MacDestination`, `MacNavigationState`, `MacRootView.body`, `selectedDetail`); `Voxboard Mac/MacLocalizationScreenshotRoot`.
- Status: shipped (screenshot harness: hidden/debug)

### F-MC-02 Transcription Model Selection & Download (Whisper / Parakeet / Apple Speech)
- Surface: Main sidebar → Configure → Transcription Models; History detail metadata
- Summary: The direct, nonmodal `MacModelView` destination lists downloadable Whisper GGML models (whisper.cpp + Metal) and Parakeet Core ML models, plus language selection near the top. Supports "Use Existing…" installs in place, downloads with progress, Select, Remove/Stop Using, Cancel, and per-model labels (Bundled / Core ML / Existing Install).
- Details:
  - Sections "01 Language", "02 Whisper Models", and "03 Parakeet Models"; model groups filter `WhisperModelInfo.availableModels` by `engine.isParakeet`, and the language picker binds to `modelManager.selectedLanguage` (`availableLanguages`).
  - Download states: preparing, listingFiles ("Finding files…"), verifying, cancelling, transferring (per-file progress description or %); "Keep Vox.md open" hint; Cancel disabled while cancelling.
  - "Use Existing…" opens NSOpenPanel: Parakeet → folder containing Preprocessor/Encoder/Decoder/JointDecision `.mlmodelc` + `parakeet_vocab.json`; Whisper → single GGML `.bin`, used in place without copying. `Stop Using` (external) vs `Delete` for downloaded models.
  - Model operation failures render in a dismissible inline banner via `modelManager.modelOperationError`, preserving navigation and model controls.
  - Recording-time gating: `MacRecorder.validateSelectedModel` (MacRecorder.swift ~lines 630–645) — `automatic` backend allowed; otherwise model must be selected AND downloaded, with two distinct localized errors that the Capture error banner converts into a deep link to open Models (`shouldOpenModelsFromError`, MacCaptureWorkspaceView.swift).
- Constraints: automatic selection maps to Apple Speech backend (shared code); Whisper/Parakeet require local model files.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` `MacModelView` (~lines 205–425); `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` `validateSelectedModel` (~630).
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-03 Capture Preset (Vox) Library Management
- Surface: Main sidebar → Configure → Capture Presets (`MacCapturePresetSettingsView`)
- Summary: Persistent two-pane preset editor: the preset collection remains visible beside the selected editor, with add (custom), delete, and an editor form covering identity, capture processing, destination, legacy export, metadata, location, speaker ID, and audio retention.
- Details (editor sections, `MacCapturePresetEditor`, MacRootView.swift ~lines 470–1140):
  - **Identity**: name, icon picker (`MacFlowIconPickerView`, 50 curated SF Symbols in 5 categories with search), Enabled toggle, "Use as Capture Default" (disabled unless enabled; badge "Default for Capture").
  - **Capture Processing**: "Use Apple Intelligence" master toggle, "Apply To" scope picker (`both/voiceOnly/textOnly`, shown when toggled on) + info sheet `MacCaptureTextProcessingInfoView` (on-device Apple Intelligence, local fallback keeps original text); Mode picker (`none/clean/todoList/meetingNotes/custom` with per-mode help text); custom instruction TextEditor; "Empty Capture Prompt" text.
  - **Destination**: shows owned `CaptureDestination` (root name + "target · placement" summary) with Edit/Set Up sheet → `MacCaptureDestinationEditor`; route migration clears `captureEntryTemplateID`/placement override and legacy markdown template settings when destination defines its own template path (`CapturePresetStore.migratingLegacyMarkdownTemplate`).
  - **Legacy Voice File Export** (only when `captureDestinationID == nil`): exportEnabled toggle; export/audio/markdown-template folder pickers via security-scoped bookmarks; Format picker (`ExportFileFormat` incl. TXT/MD/JSON/YAML); New File vs Append mode; filename template tokens `{timestamp} {date} {time} {YR} {id8} {id} {model} {language}`; Obsidian Bases toggle; Markdown template file binding.
  - **Metadata**: scope picker (document note frontmatter vs entry inline `key:: value`); static frontmatter editor (monospaced TextEditor, sorted render, colon-parse on change).
  - **Location**: enable toggle; precision Exact/City; unavailable behavior Ask/Send-Without/Cancel; metadata output structured-fields (per-field toggles + custom output key) or advanced YAML template (placeholders `{{coordinates}} {{city}} {{timestamp}} {{id}}`); live delivery preview or validation error (`CaptureLocationConfigurationPreview`); scope-conflict warning (advanced template + entry scope) with fix button; "Reset Location Unavailable Choice" and "Reset Location Configuration"; privacy copy (reverse geocoder network use, no background tracking, provider-link disclosure).
  - **Voice Processing**: "Identify Speakers" diarization toggle with explanatory copy (on-device, model downloads on first use, best-effort with skip reason shown in History).
  - **Voice Audio**: Save Audio mode (off / attachmentsFolder / etc.), attachments folder name (relative to unified destination, blank = default), "Embed Audio in Markdown" (gated by `markdownAudioEmbedAvailable`: destination present OR md format OR markdown template OR yaml-with-.md) with embed-placement picker.
  - Deletion: only non-builtin; retires owned destination route via `CapturePresetStore.retirePreset`; falls selection back to first preset/`generalId` and repairs selected capture profile if needed.
  - Persistence: flows auto-saved on change; `onAppear` sets `usesCustomExportSettings = true` for legacy flows; async destination load keeps in-flight edits of route-owned fields only.
- Constraints: none beyond storage availability (`MacCapturePresetDestinationError.storageUnavailable` if `AppConstants.captureLibraryURL` nil).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` lines ~427–1142 (`MacCapturePresetSettingsView`, `MacCapturePresetEditor`, `MacFlowIconPickerView`, `MacCaptureTextProcessingInfoView`, `CapturePresetProcessingMode.helpText`).
- Status: shipped (Legacy Voice File Export section: legacy fallback for un-migrated presets)

### F-MC-04 Capture Workspace (Draft Composer, Attachments, Recording Controls)
- Surface: Capture destination (default); menu-bar "Show Capture"; app shortcuts/deep links
- Summary: The primary capture surface: durable Markdown draft composer (AppKit text view) with attachment strip, recording status bar, action bar, and Markdown toolbar. Shares the iOS durable-draft/delivery model via `QuickCaptureViewModel`.
- Details:
  - **Header**: status badge (Recording/Transcribing/Finishing Export/Finding Location/Draft Saved Locally); preset menu (enabled flows; disabled while recording); route button showing destination preview (or one-off note basename) opening the per-window trailing `MacCaptureRouteInspector`; free-tier counter button ("N captures · N.N min" / "Unlock Capture") opening paywall; History and Settings icon buttons. Preset location remains configured in Capture Preset settings rather than occupying a persistent toolbar item.
  - **Destination setup banner** (amber) when no destination configured and not in screenshot mode.
  - **Composer**: `MacMarkdownComposerTextView` (F-MC-12) filling space; drop destination for URLs with blue highlight + dashed overlay; a rotating `InspirationQuoteService` quote remains visible across preset and attachment changes until text is inserted; hint "Type Markdown, dictate, paste, or drop files anywhere in this window."
  - **Attachment strip**: chips per payload (text/url/audio/retainedAudio/image/file/scannedDocument/sketch) with per-item remove; labels and icons per `payloadIcon`/`payloadLabel`.
  - **Recording status bar**: state text, meeting subtitle naming captured application ("Capturing X with separate System and Mic audio"), draft-mode subtitle, per-source System/Mic level meters + status text + last warning (meeting mode), Stop button, transcription percentage progress.
  - **Action bar**: History, "Reveal Last Capture" (Finder reveal of last receipt, security-scoped), input-mode segmented picker Microphone/Meeting (with help text), result picker "Add to Draft" vs "Send Immediately", "Audio" checkbox (draft mode: attach recording to draft), Record/Stop button, Send Capture (⌘↩, disabled while submitting/processing/recording/transcribing; shows "Unlock" when free standard capture is at limit). Free-limit path: `captureAllowanceBlocked` → paywall.
  - **Markdown toolbar**: "Add attachment" menu (Images or Screenshots…, Take Photo…, Import Scan or PDF…, Sketch…, Files…, Audio Attachment…, Transcribe Audio or Video…, Web Link…, Paste); Undo; Format menu (⌘B Bold, ⌘I Italic, Hashtag, Heading 1–6); Markdown link; Internal link `[[`; Due date; Checklist; Bullet list; Timestamp; Date (yyyy-MM-dd); Case menu (Lowercase/Uppercase/Sentence case/Capitalize Words/Slugify).
  - **Attachment ingestion** (`chooseImages`/`chooseScan`/`chooseFiles`/`chooseAudio`/`stageURLs`): NSOpenPanel per type; `CaptureInputBudget.reserveSharedItems` preflight; per-URL UTType detection; `viewModel.stageFile` with `embedAsImage`/`embedAsAudio` flags.
  - **Scan import**: images run through `MacDocumentScanProcessor` (F-MC-11) then `viewModel.stageScan(pageImages:pdfData:extractedText:)`; non-image PDFs staged as files.
  - **Paste** (`pasteIntoCapture`): pasteboard URLs → stage; PNG data → stage as pasted-image PNG; TIFF → converted PNG; http(s) string → `addURL`; other text → insert at selection.
  - **Inspector accessory tools**: one per-window `MacCaptureInspectorTool` selects Web Link, Internal Link, Camera, Sketch, or Due Date in the same trailing inspector. Link fields preserve complete http(s) validation and `CaptureInsertionFormatter.wikiLink` errors; the due-date DatePicker supports optional time. Camera/sketch stop or discard their local tool state when the inspector closes while staged draft content remains durable.
  - **Inline location decisions**: prominent banners keep the Capture draft visible/editable while offering Retry / Send Without Location / Always Send Without for Preset / Cancel. The inbox-drain banner offers Send / Always Send / Discard; Discard alone requires a genuine destructive confirmation before deleting the queued Capture.
  - **Error banner**: red banner for viewModel/recorder errors; model errors become clickable "Open Transcription Models"; inline "Retry queued captures" when `failedInboxCount > 0`; "Reveal preserved recording" when `lastRecoveryAudioURL` set.
  - **Sent toast**: "Capture Sent" capsule for 2s after `viewModel.lastReceipt`, then re-focus composer.
  - Lifecycle: draft autosave on text change (skipped while live transcript preview is active), save on disappear, token-targeted `requestedInput` consumption (photos/screenshots/camera/files/scan/sketch/link/voice), notifications for show/chooseFiles/clearDraft, and capture-workspace readiness registration with `MacWindowCoordinator` only after the cold-load barrier.
- Constraints: microphone permission required (`AudioRecorder.requestMicrophonePermission`) with localized error; free limit (15 min / 10 captures, from UsageTracker) gates recording/import and standard captures.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacCaptureWorkspaceView.swift` (`MacCaptureWorkspaceView`, `MacCaptureInspectorTool`, inline location banners, inspector tool views).
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-05 Capture Route Inspector (Per-Capture Route Overrides)
- Surface: Capture header route button; native trailing `.inspector` owned by the selected Capture window
- Summary: Persistent, nonmodal one-off routing for the current Capture: edit the preset destination, choose per-capture placement, entry template, and one-off target note while the draft remains visible.
- Details:
  - Preset section: preset identity; Edit/Set Up destination pushes `MacCaptureDestinationEditor` inside the inspector's `NavigationStack` rather than presenting a sheet. The editor retains validation, security-scoped bookmarks, native file/folder panels, async save, and destination identity; its Presets caller retains the prior 680×620 modal minimum.
  - "Only for this Capture": Placement picker (Preset Default / Top / Bottom mapping to prepend/append overrides), Entry Template picker (Preset Default or any library template, saved to draft), "Choose another Markdown note" NSOpenPanel (`.md`, starting in vault root → `viewModel.setOneOffNote`), "Use Preset Defaults" reset when overrides exist.
  - Resolved Note section: monospaced `viewModel.resolvedDestinationPreview`, text-selectable.
  - Closing or switching away from Route calls `saveDraftNow`; normal override mutations continue to schedule durable draft saves. No Done/dismiss/modal frame remains.
  - DEBUG-only story `07-capture-route-inspector` renders the real Capture and Route inspector side by side without entering the existing localization screenshot matrix.
- Constraints: destination-dependent sections only when a destination exists.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacCaptureWorkspaceView.swift` `MacCaptureRouteInspector`; `Voxboard Mac/MacCaptureDestinationLibraryView.swift` `embeddedInNavigation` presentation.
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-06 Temporary Transcription (Transcribe to Clipboard)
- Surface: Global keybind "Transcribe to Clipboard"; Capture menu "Start/Stop Recording" (⇧⌘R); Recording Queue results
- Summary: `MacRecordingCompletionMode.transcriptionOnly` records from anywhere and copies the finished transcript to the clipboard, or leaves it in Recording Queue for explicit copy when deferred.
- Details:
  - Recording jobs staged via `RecordingJobHandoffIntentStore` before enqueue (`source == .macClipboard`).
  - Immediate results auto-copy **once**: `markAutomaticClipboardDeliveryAttempted` is persisted *before* touching the pasteboard so a crash/relaunch can never overwrite newer clipboard content (MacRecorder.swift ~lines 1105–1125).
  - Deferred policy jobs return `transcriptText` for explicit Copy in Recording Queue.
  - Failure: clipboard copy failure surfaces "copy from the recording queue" error and preserves audio; `usageTracker.addUsage` on success; transcript persisted to TranscriptStore.
  - Meets free limit check both at record start and at queued-job execution (`MacRecordingHandoffError.transcriptionLimitReached`).
- Constraints: free tier limit; model validation.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` `executeQueuedJob`, `finishSuccessfulTranscription` (clipboard branch), `MacRecordingHandoffError`.
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-07 Global Keyboard Shortcuts (Hotkeys, any app)
- Surface: Settings → Shortcuts; Carbon hotkey registration; Capture menu; menu bar
- Summary: System-wide record start/stop hotkeys with three target types: Transcribe-to-Clipboard, Selected Capture Preset, and one binding per enabled Capture Preset. Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey` based.
- Details:
  - Targets (`MacHotKeyTarget`): `.transcriptionOnly`, `.selectedPreset`, `.preset(id)`. Preset bindings ignored (beep) if preset no longer exists/enabled at press time (`configureGlobalHotKeys`, VoxboardMacApp.swift).
  - `MacHotKeyShortcut`: requires ⌃/⌥/⌘ (⇧ combinable); key naming table for Return/Tab/Space/Delete/Escape/Clear/Enter, F1–F16, arrows; display string ⌃⌥⇧⌘+KEY.
  - Persistence (`MacHotKeyStore`, shared defaults): `macGlobalHotKeyShortcut` (legacy single selected-preset binding retained for compatibility), `macTranscriptionOnlyHotKeyShortcut`, `macCapturePresetHotKeyShortcuts` (JSON dictionary). `configuredBindings()` and `conflictingTarget(for:excluding:activePresetIDs:)` (conflicts with disabled presets ignored).
  - Inline editor `MacHotKeyRecorderView`: replaces the shortcut list within the persistent Settings detail; hidden `MacHotKeyCaptureNSView` (a `MacKeyboardHintSuppressingResponder`) captures keyDown/flagsChanged; Esc and Back/Cancel return to the list; Shift-only warning; conflict validation inline and at save; Save/Clear.
  - Registration `MacGlobalHotKeyCenter.reloadRegistration()`: unregisters all, registers enabled bindings with signature `VOXH`; per-shortcut OSStatus error surfaced as `lastRegistrationError` in Settings; all activity logged to `KeyboardDebugLog`.
  - Press behavior (`handleGlobalHotKey`): toggle — if recording, stop+transcribe; else free-limit check (needsUnlock + show Capture), microphone permission check (error + show Capture), then `startRecording` with flow/completion; if start failed, reveal Capture window with the error.
  - Menu equivalents: ⇧⌘C Show Capture, ⇧⌘H Show History in the preferred main window, ⇧⌘R Start/Stop Recording, ⇧⌘A Add Files to Capture (VoxboardMacApp `CommandMenu("Capture")`).
  - "Clear Capture Draft" menu item (disabled when draft empty). Vox.md menu: Reveal Data Folder; Visibility submenu mirroring all four modes.
  - `MacKeyboardHintCenter` never triggers while a hotkey-recorder first responder is active.
- Constraints: hotkeys registered only while app runs; conflicting system shortcuts fail registration with an OSStatus message.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/VoxboardMacApp.swift` (`MacHotKeyTarget`, `MacHotKeyShortcut`, `MacHotKeyStore`, `MacGlobalHotKeyCenter`, `macHotKeyHandler`, CommandMenus, `configureGlobalHotKeys`, `handleGlobalHotKey` — roughly lines 140–330, 700–1010); `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` `MacSettingsView.hotKeySettings` / `MacHotKeyRecorderView`.
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-08 Keyboard Hints (Control-B Vimium-style click labels)
- Surface: Any key app window; hidden feature
- Summary: Pressing ⌃B overlays yellow keyboard labels on every clickable control; typing label prefixes clicks the target.
- Details:
  - Trigger: unmodified Control-B (keyCode 11), non-repeat, on a visible non-miniaturized key window; beeps if no candidates. Skipped when the first responder is a `MacKeyboardHintSuppressingResponder` (hotkey recorder).
  - `MacKeyboardHintLabelGenerator`: prefix-free home-row-ordered alphabet labels ("asdfghjkl…" then "qwerty…" etc.), 1–2+ chars as needed.
  - Candidate discovery: enabled NSControls with actions, editable/selectible text fields, text views, NSSegmentedControl segments (per-segment frames), SwiftUI buttons via `FocusRingView` type-name heuristic (priority 1 vs native 0); dedup by 88% frame-overlap + activation-point proximity; min 4×4 visible frame.
  - Interaction: unmodified letters append prefix (prefix chars render inverted on badge), Delete backspaces, Esc/any mouse/scroll/modified key dismisses, unmatched key beeps + dismiss; activation synthesizes a left-click event pair.
  - Overlay: borderless non-key `NSPanel` child window, ignores mouse, yellow rounded badges clamped to bounds; sessions dismissed on app resign-active and window move/resize/key-loss/close.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacKeyboardHintCenter.swift` (entire file, 617 lines).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: hidden

### F-MC-09 Menu Bar Operation
- Surface: `MenuBarExtra` (visibility-gated); menu-bar icon
- Summary: A menu-bar item with live status icon/tooltip and a full quick-action menu when the visibility mode includes the menu bar.
- Details:
  - Icon: `record.circle.fill` (recording), `waveform.circle.fill` (transcribing/exporting), else `mic.circle`; tooltip text mirrors state.
  - Menu content (`MacMenuBarMenu`): status title (Ready/Recording/Transcribing/Finishing Export); live duration or last error or selected model name; Stop + Transcribe or Start Recording (titled "Unlock to Record" with lock icon at free limit); Import Audio… (NSOpenPanel audio/movie → `importAudioFile`); Copy Last Transcript; speaker-diarization skip reason row (orange); Reveal Last Export; Capture Preset picker (enabled flows, disabled while recording); Show Capture (⌘0), Show History, Reveal Data Folder, Quit (⌘Q).
  - Recording start from menu reuses the permission/limit/error flow and reveals Capture window on failure.
  - On appear: reload usage tracker and transcript store.
- Constraints: `MenuBarExtra(isInserted:)` bound to `visibilityMode.showsMenuBar` (see F-MC-10).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/VoxboardMacApp.swift` `MenuBarExtra` scene + `MacMenuBarMenu` (~lines 1040–1350).
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-10 App Visibility Modes (Dock / Menu Bar / Hidden)
- Surface: Settings → General → Visibility; Vox.md menu → Visibility submenu; `MacAppVisibilityMode`
- Summary: Four user-selectable presence modes: Dock + Menu Bar, Menu Bar Only, Dock Only, Hidden.
- Details:
  - Modes map to `NSApplication.ActivationPolicy`: regular (dock modes) vs accessory (menu-bar-only, hidden); `apply()` / `applyImmediately()` switch policy async/synchronously; stored in shared defaults key `macAppVisibilityMode`; applied at launch (`applicationDidFinishLaunching`), on change, and on every main-window route (`showMain`) so an accessory app still comes forward.
  - Per-mode footnotes in Settings describing recovery (Spotlight/Finder/Launchpad for Hidden).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/VoxboardMacApp.swift` `MacAppVisibilityMode` (~lines 630–700); `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` `visibilitySettings`.
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-11 Window Coordination, Deep Links, Termination Safety
- Surface: App lifecycle; `voxmd://` URLs; Dock reopen; quit flow
- Summary: `MacWindowCoordinator` routes commands to the correct scene window; the app delegate handles URLs, activation, reopen, and a draft-flush-on-quit gate.
- Details:
  - Coordinator tracks main windows by token (registered via `MacSceneWindowRegistrar`/`WindowProbeView`) and pending typed navigation/file requests; prefers the key main window, then the frontmost ordered main window, then any visible/miniaturized main window; deminiaturizes and activates; falls back to `openWindow` + activate when none. Capture navigation and `chooseFiles` first select Capture, then remain pending until that token's workspace crosses its load barrier; one token-scoped focus event consumes shared requested input and file-panel delivery follows when requested — no timing heuristic.
  - Deep links (`handleURL`): `voxmd://capture` / `voxmd://capture-request` (parsed by `CaptureDeepLinkParser` → `viewModel.handleDeepLink`) and `voxmd://listen`; capture actions finish the serialized load/mutation/durable-persist path before requesting targeted Capture routing, while parse errors are surfaced before Capture is shown. Scene `.handlesExternalEvents(matching: ["capture","capture-request","listen"])`.
  - Cross-launch handoff: `consumePendingQuickCaptureOpenIfNeeded` reads shared-defaults pending-open flags (source, vox ID, requested input) written elsewhere (e.g. iOS/watch), applies them in that order, and only then routes the preferred main window into Capture.
  - `applicationShouldTerminate`: asynchronous reply; if recording or exporting, refuses quit with "Wait for the current recording or Capture export to finish before quitting." and reveals Capture; otherwise flushes the durable draft (`flushDraftForTermination`).
  - Reopen (Dock click with no windows) shows Capture; `applicationDidBecomeActive` resumes the recording queue and retries the failed inbox.
  - Periodic inbox drain: a `while` loop in the main window scene task sleeps 300s and calls `processPendingInbox()` so queued captures retry without foreground activation; also drained at launch and on unlock.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/VoxboardMacApp.swift` (`MacWindowCoordinator`, `VoxboardMacAppDelegate`, `handleURL`, `consumePendingQuickCaptureOpenIfNeeded`, scene `.task`).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-12 Markdown Composer (AppKit text engine)
- Surface: Capture workspace composer
- Summary: `NSTextView`-backed editor (`MacMarkdownComposerTextView`) wrapped for SwiftUI, retaining native undo, find panel, spell checking, Services, selection, and drag behavior.
- Details:
  - Controller API: focus/dismissFocus, undo/redo, replaceAll (with undo registration + "Edit Markdown" action name), replaceSelection (optional select-inserted), UTF16-clamped ranges.
  - Config: plain text (non-rich), no graphics import, allowsUndo, usesFindPanel; quote/dash/text-replacement substitution disabled; continuous spell checking on; GeistMono 16pt (fallback monospace system); insertion point styled.
  - Accessibility: label "Capture note", identifier `mac_quick_capture_text`.
  - Coordinator publishes text/selection/focus bindings bidirectionally; programmatic focus deferred to next runloop.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacMarkdownComposerTextView.swift` (entire file, 210 lines).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-13 Microphone Recording (Queue-backed, crash-safe)
- Surface: Capture workspace Record button; global hotkeys; menu bar
- Summary: `MacRecorder.startRecording` captures mic audio into a durable recording-job pipeline: handoff intent journaled before transcription, capture lease held during recording, live transcript preview for draft mode, and full crash recovery via the shared Recording Queue.
- Details:
  - Guards: not already recording/starting/finalizing; free limit → `needsUnlock` + error; model validation; `AudioRecorder.startRecording` failure → microphone privacy error.
  - Stop path (`stopAndTranscribe`): staged `RecordingJobHandoffIntent` saved to the recordings directory before enqueue; origin-location snapshot journaled (see F-MC-14); enqueue with model/fallback/language, delivery, voice-processing config, queue preferences; any handoff failure preserves original audio at `lastRecoveryAudioURL`.
  - Live preview (draft mode only): Apple Speech `SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest` with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition`, partial results, fed from the recorder's audio buffer tap; finalized vs volatile text pushed as `liveTranscript` events; invalidation handler on stop; requires authorized on-device recognizer for the selected locale.
  - Queued execution (`executeQueuedJob`): draft audio staging event; transcription with progress; speaker diarization resolution (skip reason surfaced & logged); transcript persistence with persistence-error propagation; usage accounting; per-mode completion (clipboard / draft events / preset export).
  - DEBUG runtime validation hooks: `--runtime-queue-pause-after-claim` (sleep 30s in executor), `--runtime-queue-validation` + `--runtime-microphone-capture` + `VOXBOARD_SHARED_CONTAINER_OVERRIDE` env → automated 2s mic capture and queue result file under `/tmp/VoxQueueRuntimeValidation`.
- Constraints: free limit checked at start and execution; mic permission.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` lines 60–300, 1060–1200 (`startRecording`, `stopAndTranscribe`, `executeQueuedJob`, `startLivePreviewIfSupported`, debug hooks).
- Status: shipped (debug hooks: hidden)

### F-MC-14 Origin-Time Location Resolution (Crash-safe journaling)
- Surface: Capture preset location policy (F-MC-03) applied to recordings and imports
- Summary: When a preset enables location, the origin boundary is journaled durably: a stop-time "unavailable" placeholder is persisted, then atomically replaced with the resolved outcome, so a later retry can never acquire a *newer* location for the same capture.
- Details:
  - `beginOriginLocationResolution` builds a `MacOriginLocationResolution` task: reuse existing snapshot for the same retained recording; re-key a recovery recording ID when preset matches; otherwise save placeholder → `CaptureLocationService().resolveLocation(policy:source:)` → save final snapshot.
  - Draft-mode journal events (`.origin`/`.clearOrigin`) must be acknowledged (`true`) or `originMetadataPersistenceFailed` aborts; on partial failure the durable draft retains the placeholder.
  - Import path re-keys the origin store from the retained source copy to the converted WAV, deleting prior entries; cancellation cleans store entries.
  - Snapshots removed after successful delivery (`canRemoveOriginSnapshot`).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` `beginOriginLocationResolution`, `MacOriginLocationResolution` (~lines 620–760, 2060).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-15 Audio & Video Import for Transcription
- Surface: Capture toolbar "Transcribe Audio or Video…"; menu bar "Import Audio…"
- Summary: Import an audio or movie file and run it through the same preset/queue pipeline as recordings; source is copied into app storage and converted to Whisper WAV off-main-thread.
- Details:
  - NSOpenPanel accepts `.audio`/`.movie`; free-limit and model gates; busy guard ("Finish the current recording before importing audio.").
  - Security-scoped access on the source; copy to `mac_import_source_<uuid>.<ext>`; `AudioFileConverter.convertToWhisperWAV` → `mac_import_<uuid>.wav`; duration from converted or source file; recovery-origin detection when re-importing a preserved recording.
  - Handoff intent staged & finalized with `captureSource = .fileImport`, `source = .importedAudio`; draft-mode origin journaling (including a no-location profile snapshot event); failure preserves the imported source copy at `lastRecoveryAudioURL` and clears draft origin.
  - Non-audio "audio attachment" import path separately stages files as draft payloads (F-MC-04).
- Constraints: free limit; one import at a time.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` `importAudioFile` (~lines 300–470).
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-16 Meeting Capture (ScreenCaptureKit + mic, app picker, dual stems)
- Surface: Capture workspace input-mode "Meeting"
- Summary: `MacMeetingCaptureCoordinator` records one selected application's system audio via ScreenCaptureKit while simultaneously recording the microphone via AVCaptureSession, chunking both stems to disk with a recovery manifest.
- Details:
  - Picker: `SCContentSharingPicker` in `.singleApplication` mode, change disallowed, excludes Vox.md itself; cancel → `pickerCancelled`; failure callback surfaced as state error. Selected app name resolved via `filter.includedApplications` (macOS 15.2+; nil and "Selected application" fallback on macOS 14 without guessing).
  - SCStream config: audio only (2×2px dummy video, 1fps), 48kHz stereo, excludes current-process audio; chunked `ChunkedSampleBufferWriter` per source with a shared `MeetingTimelineClock` (host clock origin).
  - Manifest (`manifest.json` in `Recordings/meeting-<uuid>/`): state machine preparing→recording→(captured|interrupted|normalizing→queued|consumed), per-chunk receipts (`.m4a.chunk.json`), timeline events, warnings; snapshots persisted atomically on a utility queue, best-effort async during capture.
  - Interruption handling: per-source one-shot latches for mic (AVCaptureSession interrupted / runtime error / device disconnected) and system (stream stop error) → warning + `interruptionHandler` → `MacRecorder.handleMeetingInterruption` finalizes the meeting.
  - Stop: single-stop task; finalize both writers via dispatch group; drain finalization mailbox; warn if a stem empty; state = completed (no warnings) or interrupted; picker deactivated.
  - Live UI: `microphoneLevel`/`systemLevel` RMS meters (down-sampled, clamped ×4), per-source status text (Waiting/Listening/Capturing/Stopped/Error), `warnings`.
- Constraints: ScreenCaptureKit screen-recording permission implied by picker; macOS 15.2+ for app-name resolution.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacMeetingCaptureCoordinator.swift` (entire file, 650 lines).
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-17 Meeting Pipeline: Normalize, Mix, Dual-Stem Transcription, Timeline
- Surface: Post-stop processing in `MacRecorder` + shared `MeetingTranscriptAssembler`
- Summary: Interrupted-or-completed meetings are normalized (per-stem WAV from chunks), mixed for playback, and enqueued as a bundle; transcription runs on each stem separately and results are interleaved on the manifest timeline.
- Details:
  - Recovery (`recoverInterruptedMeetingSessions` on every `resumeRecordingQueue`): scans `Recordings/meeting-*` directories with symlink/containment safety checks, skips the active/finalizing session, dedups in-flight directories, recovers orphaned chunk receipts (validates filename/byte-count/duration), reconciles against existing durable jobs by session ID (marks consumed + deletes staging, or re-queues), marks preparing/recording → interrupted with "Recovered after Vox.md was interrupted." warning, then normalizes.
  - `normalizeAndEnqueueMeeting`: `AudioFileConverter.normalizeMeetingStem` per source, `mixWhisperWAVStreaming` mix; bundle artifacts with roles `.playbackMix`, `.meetingTimeline` (manifest), `.meetingMicrophone`, `.meetingSystem`; manifest state → queued *before* staging cleanup (crash-reconciliation boundary).
  - `executeMeetingJob`: transcribes each stem with progress; maps segments to the manifest timeline (`mapToMeetingTimeline`) or falls back to whole-file timed units with a warning; interleaves turns (`turns(from:)`); optional diarization on the system stem for remote speakers (`role: .remoteAnonymous`, speaker numbers offset), skipped-with-warning on error; rendered text prefixed with "⚠️ Incomplete meeting capture:" + warnings when any; backend name joined "A + B"; transcript persisted & clipboard policy applied (`MeetingClipboardPolicy`); delivery through `finishSuccessfulTranscription` with the playback mix as audio.
  - Zero chunks at stop → staging directory deleted (nothing recoverable); finalize failure leaves chunks recoverable in Recordings with an error message.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` (`recoverInterruptedMeetingSessions`, `recoverMeetingSession`, `recoverFinalizedChunkReceipts`, `isSafeMeetingDirectory`, `stopMeetingAndTranscribe`, `normalizeAndEnqueueMeeting`, `executeMeetingJob` — roughly lines 760–1050 and 1200–1310).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-18 Preset-Driven Capture Export & Apple Intelligence Enrichment
- Surface: Background delivery after preset recordings/imports
- Summary: `finishSuccessfulTranscription` (preset branch) formats the transcript per preset, persists it, optionally enriches it with Apple Intelligence, then delivers Markdown (+ audio) to the configured destination or legacy file export, with checkpointed audio delivery and recovery-preserving failure semantics.
- Details:
  - `TranscriptFlowFormatter.apply(flow:to:)` then TranscriptStore persistence; usage added only after successful delivery.
  - AI enrichment: `TranscriptEnricher` with `FoundationModelsBackend` — gated to macOS 26+ and `FoundationModelsBackend.isAvailable`, else nil (Settings row shows READY/UNAVAILABLE/macOS 26+). Enrichment runs only when `flow.usesAIEnrichment`.
  - Unified destination path: `ConfiguredTranscriptCaptureDestinationExporter.export(...)`; errors classified — `.queuedForRetry` (audio+outcome copied to durable inbox, retry handler `processPendingInbox` invoked, delivery treated as success), `.locationUnavailableCancelled` ("Capture canceled because this preset requires an origin-time location."), others surface "Your transcript was saved locally. …" and expose recovery audio when not yet durable.
  - Legacy export routing (destination-less): Smart Folder routing (only when preset has no explicit export folder, `smartFoldersEnabled`) and Auto-Organize subfolder naming via FoundationModels — both deadline-bounded at **30s** (`exportRoutingTimeout`) so a stalled model can't hang delivery; folder listing under security scope for existing-name awareness.
  - `prepareFlowForFileExportIfNeeded`: prompts for a missing/expired per-flow or global export-folder permission via NSOpenPanel (security-scoped bookmark), persisting only folder fields onto the current stored flow (immutable-snapshot safe).
  - Audio: `retainAudioIfNeeded` copies to `mac_export_audio_<uuid>`; `CheckpointedAudioDelivery` delivers audio + Markdown reference with note/audio/audio-reference transaction directories and queue checkpoints (`markExportedNote/Audio/AudioReferenceAttached`); retained audio deleted only after durable success; failures keep it for recovery with tailored messages ("The note was saved, but its audio attachment failed. …").
  - Export mode checkpointing reuses previously exported note path if the file still exists (retry-idempotent).
  - `isExporting` UI state; `lastExportURL` for menu-bar reveal.
- Constraints: enrichment and smart routing require macOS 26 + Apple Intelligence; everything on-device.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` `finishSuccessfulTranscription` (~lines 1500–1730); `VoxboardMacApp` init for enricher gating (lines 30–45); `MacRootView.swift` `appleIntelligenceStatus/Detail`.
- Status: shipped (enrichment/routing: gated on macOS 26+)

### F-MC-19 Speaker Diarization (Identify Speakers)
- Surface: Preset "Voice Processing" toggle; History rows; menu bar
- Summary: On-device speaker identification labels multiple voices after transcription; best-effort with visible skip reasons.
- Details:
  - `SpeakerDiarizationService.resolve(audioURL:transcription:configuration:)` — configuration nil for transcription-only mode (no labels for clipboard jobs); skip reason stored on the transcript (`lastSpeakerDiarizationSkipReason`) and logged via `KeyboardDebugLog`.
  - History rows and detail show "N speaker(s)" and the skip-reason warning label; menu bar shows the reason in orange.
  - Meeting mode uses diarize on the system stem for remote speakers (F-MC-17); speaker model downloads on first use (per Settings copy).
  - Turn structure preserved (`speakerTurns` on `Transcript`).
- Constraints: model download on first use; may skip (reason surfaced).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` (resolve call sites); `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` `MacHistoryView`/`MacTranscriptDetailView`.
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-20 Capture Destination Library (Vault Routing)
- Surface: Preset editor destination sheet; Route Inspector; `MacCaptureDestinationEditor`
- Summary: Full editor for a `CaptureDestination`: vault/folder security-scoped root, note target (new/rolling/existing), placement, entry formatting (library template, vault template, or prefix/suffix), attachments folder, and retry protection.
- Details:
  - Target kinds: New Note (path template), Rolling Note (period picker `CaptureRollingPeriod`), Existing Note (relative path with "Choose Existing Note…" picker constrained to root). Path tokens listed: `{date} {time} {hour} {minute} {second} {timestamp} {year} {YR} {month} {day} {period} {week} {id8}`.
  - Placement: append / prepend / beneath heading (heading title, level stepper 1–6, missing-heading behavior Show Error vs Create Heading).
  - Entry formatting: vault Markdown template (`markdownTemplatePath`, read fresh from the vault every capture so Obsidian edits apply; supports `{location}`) OR reusable library template (picker disables prefix/suffix fields) OR custom prefix/suffix TextEditors; entry tokens incl. `{source}`, `{id}`, `{location}` with a rendered `{location}` sample preview.
  - Delivery: "Retry Protection" toggle — adds a `vox-capture` HTML comment per entry to prevent duplicates on retry (disclosed as possibly visible while editing).
  - Validation & preflight: folder required; relative-path validation for path and attachments folder; heading required; existing-note existence + `MarkdownDocumentEditor` mutation dry-run; template inside root + ≤ `CaptureInputLimits.maximumTextCharacters`; template may not equal destination note; stale bookmark → "permission expired, choose again" error; detailed `MacCaptureRouteError` messages.
  - Save path persists via caller-provided closure (`CaptureLibraryStore.update`, default destination assigned if none) — editor itself is UI-only.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacCaptureDestinationLibraryView.swift` (entire file, 424 lines).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-21 Entry Template Library
- Surface: Main sidebar → Configure → Entry Templates (`MacEntryTemplateLibraryView`)
- Summary: Persistent list/detail editor for reusable Markdown entry templates (name + prefix + suffix) stored in the shared capture library; import from a `.md` file.
- Details:
  - The 280-point collection pane remains visible beside the selected inline editor; stored templates show a line-count summary and local unsaved add/import drafts show an Unsaved label.
  - Add and Import select inline draft editors rather than sheets. Import retains the native NSOpenPanel and enforces `.md`, UTF-8, and size guards (bytes ≤ 4× limit, chars ≤ `maximumTextCharacters`), with the name derived from the filename ("Imported Template" fallback).
  - Editor: monospaced prefix/suffix editors, token help line, `{location}` sample preview, required name, inline validation/save status, Save, and Discard Draft or Delete controls.
  - Save preserves the draft/template UUID, updates shared storage, and keeps that template selected. Delete confirms destructively, then for destinations referencing it copies the removed prefix/suffix inline and clears `entryTemplateID` (no dangling references); it also calls `CapturePresetStore.clearCaptureEntryTemplate` and selects a coherent fallback.
- Constraints: shared capture storage must be available.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacEntryTemplateLibraryView.swift` (entire file, 401 lines).
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-22 History Browsing, Search, Persistent Detail, Delete, Reveal
- Surface: Main sidebar → Work → History; persistent collection and adjacent detail
- Summary: A desktop list/detail destination merging local transcripts with capture-delivery records. Search, queued-capture recovery, and collection selection remain visible while transcript or capture-only metadata is inspected; details are embedded rather than sheet-presented.
- Details:
  - Merge: transcripts from `TranscriptStore` join `CaptureHistoryRecord` by request UUID (delivery status/path context); capture-only records are included separately and the result sorts newest-first. `MacUnifiedHistoryItem.id` is the shared UUID, so selection remains stable if a reload promotes a capture-only record to a transcript.
  - Collection: keyboard-friendly `List(selection:)` with compact transcript and capture-only rows, `.searchable` over `TranscriptSearch.matches` plus the capture haystack (destination, preset, note path, source, outcome, failure category), item count, empty/search-empty states, and "Needs Attention" retry action (`retryFailedInbox`).
  - Selection reconciliation: preserves a still-valid UUID across refreshes, chooses the first visible item after load/search, selects an adjacent fallback on delete, clears during Clear All, and renders explicit unselected/empty detail states.
  - Transcript detail: inline header with Copy (Cleaned/Raw menu when distinct) and Delete; duration/model/language/category/tags/speaker metadata and diarization skip reason; selectable cleaned and raw text cards. A joined delivery card shows status, destination, created/delivered time, source, preset, note path, attachments, failure, and Reveal when valid.
  - Capture-only detail: inline delivery status and the same privacy-limited delivery metadata, with Reveal for delivered note paths and Delete. No app-authored detail sheet or Done-to-dismiss affordance remains.
  - Clear All uses a genuine destructive confirmation and clears transcript content plus Capture delivery metadata while explicitly **not** deleting exported Markdown notes or attachments. Reload refreshes both stores.
  - Reveal preserves the secure path: resolve the destination bookmark, reject stale permission, validate a contained relative note URL, then activate Finder (`MacHistoryRevealError.destinationMissing/.permissionExpired`). Errors continue through `viewModel.errorMessage`.
  - DEBUG story `02-history` injects nonpersistent transcript/delivered/capture-only fixtures into the existing screenshot harness so list and selected detail can be visually validated without modifying production history.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` `MacHistoryView`, `MacTranscriptDetailView`, `MacCaptureHistoryDetailView`, `MacCaptureDeliveryMetadataView`, `MacHistoryScreenshotFixture`, `MacUnifiedHistoryItem`, `MacHistoryRevealError`.
- Constraints: persisted history is privacy-limited; screenshot fixtures compile only in DEBUG.
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-23 Recording Queue (Retry & Recovery)
- Surface: "Recording Queue" sidebar destination (`RecordingQueueView`, shared component); History retry button
- Summary: Durable queue of recording jobs with per-job retry (model, language, delivery override, recovery presets), transcript checkpoints for clipboard jobs, automatic-clipboard-attempt tracking, and export path checkpointing.
- Details (Mac-side behaviors):
  - Retry action wired in `MacRootView`: `recorder.recordingQueue.retry(job, modelID: selected, fallbackModelID:, replaceFallbackModelID: true, language:, delivery:)`.
  - Capture leases serialize live recording vs queue execution; queue resumed on launch, activation, and after finishes; recovery preset flows offered for jobs requiring re-routing (`recoveryRoutingRequired` error: "Choose a Capture Preset before retrying this recovered recording.").
  - Queued execution failure preserves audio ("The recording was preserved in the queue.") and classifies failure stage (delivery/storage/transcription) via `MacRecordingHandoffError.recordingJobFailureStage`.
  - Queue root: `AppConstants.recordingJobsDirectoryURL` with temp-directory fallback.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` `selectedDetail` queue case; `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` init, `resumeRecordingQueue`, `executeQueuedJob`.
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-24 StoreKit Purchases & Paywall (Individual / Family / Family Upgrade)
- Surface: Settings → Access (embedded); Capture-limit paywall sheet
- Summary: StoreKit 2 lifetime purchases: Individual Unlimited, Family Unlimited, and a discounted Family Upgrade for existing Individual owners; restore with diagnostics; transaction listener for refunds/reinstalls.
- Details:
  - `MacStoreManager.start()`: closes pending iOS-only legacy paid-app migration as non-owner on Mac ("Mac access must be backed by a current StoreKit transaction"); installs `Transaction.updates` listener (verified → finish + resync; revocation handled), then `prepareForPurchases()` (sync entitlements + load products).
  - Purchase flow: pre-sync entitlements (resolves reinstall/refund/family-change before upgrade-eligibility), eligibility check against `usageTracker.purchaseOptions` (Family upgrade only for Individual owners), product availability check, purchase → verify → `applyVerifiedPurchase` → finish → resync; states pending/cancelled/unknown tracked via `OnboardingAnalyticsClient` with paywall context and quota state.
  - Restore: `AppStore.sync()` then entitlement resync; "No Vox.md Unlimited purchase was found." when nothing restored; `recordRestoreDiagnostics` builds a `PurchaseRestoreDiagnostics` (platform macOS, sync error type, requested/loaded product IDs, storefront country, per-product `Transaction.latest` observations incl. verified/revoked/upgraded/ownership/environment/verification error) logged to KeyboardDebugLog — this is the family-restore troubleshooting surface.
  - Entitlement sync: iterates `Transaction.currentEntitlements`, skips revoked/unrecognized, finishes verified transactions, reconciles `UsageTracker.reconcileStoreEntitlements`, sets `isEntitlementStateReady`.
  - Purchase UI (`MacPaywallView`): access-level-dependent offers (free → Individual+Family cards; individual → Upgrade-to-Family card; family → unlocked badge), live prices ("PRICE UNAVAILABLE"/"CHECKING PRICE" fallbacks), usage line ("%.1f / 15 min transcription · %d / 10 captures"), Restore Purchases (disabled while restoring/purchasing), and error text.
  - Settings embeds the actual purchase/restore surface directly in Access with no app-authored sheet or Done control; the Capture-limit context retains its dismissible sheet. Both presentations re-run `prepareForPurchases`; purchases keep their StoreKit/analytics context.
- Constraints: purchase gating enforced by `UsageTracker` limits (15 min / 10 captures free).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacStoreManager.swift` (entire file, 357 lines); `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` `MacSettingsView.accessSettings`, `MacPaywallView`.
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-25 Settings Surface (Access / General / Shortcuts / Diagnostics / About)
- Surface: The one native SwiftUI `Settings` scene, opened from Capture with `openSettings`
- Summary: A persistent `NavigationSplitView` category sidebar in the exact order Access, General, Shortcuts, Diagnostics, About. The Settings scene hosts it directly without a fake `NavigationStack`; Settings is not a main-window destination. Models, Capture Presets, and Entry Templates live only in the main Configure sidebar.
- Details:
  - **Access**: embeds `MacPaywallView` nonmodally with actual entitlement, usage, Individual/Family/upgrade purchase, restore, live-price, progress, and error controls. Capture-limit purchase UI remains an allowed sheet.
  - **General**: Mac Companion rows for on-device transcription, Apple Intelligence, file export, and iOS-only keyboard/lock-screen capabilities, followed by all four working visibility modes and their recovery footnote.
  - **Shortcuts**: transcription-only, selected-preset, and enabled per-preset rows plus destination summaries and registration status. Set/Change opens `MacHotKeyRecorderView` inline in the Settings detail; conflict validation, Save, Clear, Back/Cancel, and Esc cancellation remain.
  - **Diagnostics**: embeds `MacDebugLogView`; Refresh/Clear/Copy and Reveal Data Folder expose local hotkey, recorder/exporter, and purchase-restore diagnostics without a sheet or Done control.
  - **About**: app identity, version/build, private on-device processing, and local-storage statements.
  - DEBUG localization story 03 renders this real category sidebar and selected Access detail.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/VoxboardMacApp.swift` native `Settings` scene; `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` `MacSettingsDestination`, `MacSettingsView`, `MacHotKeyRecorderView`, `MacPaywallView`, `MacDebugLogView`.
- Constraints: native StoreKit and OS dialogs remain system-managed
- Status: shipped (Diagnostics is developer-facing)

### F-MC-26 Camera Capture (Photo into Capture)
- Surface: Capture trailing inspector via toolbar "Take Photo…" or target-window requested input `.camera`
- Summary: Flexible inspector tool hosting an AVCaptureSession photo preview, delivering JPEG data to the draft as "camera-photo.jpg" through explicit close/capture callbacks.
- Details:
  - Device: default video device (built-in/external/Continuity Camera); `.photo` preset; JPEG `AVCapturePhotoSettings`; permission flow with "Open Camera Privacy Settings" deep link (`x-apple.systempreferences:...Privacy_Camera`) on denial.
  - States: configuring spinner, error states ("No camera is available. Connect a camera or enable Continuity Camera.", configuration failure, "did not return an image"), shutter disabled until ready; session start/stop on appear/disappear off-main.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacCameraCaptureView.swift` (entire file, 199 lines).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-27 Sketch Editor
- Surface: Capture trailing inspector via toolbar "Sketch…" or target-window requested input `.sketch`
- Summary: Mouse/trackpad/tablet drawing canvas saved to the draft as both a JSON vector document (`sketch.voxsketch`, content type `application/vnd.voxmd.sketch+json`) and a 2× PNG preview.
- Details:
  - Inspector-hosted stroke capture via DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0); single points render as 4pt dots; 4pt round black strokes on white; Clear/Close/Add to Capture (Add disabled with no strokes).
  - Document: `MacSketchDocument {canvasWidth, canvasHeight, strokes:[[x,y]]}` encoded JSON; PNG rendered via `ImageRenderer(scale: 2)`; staged via `viewModel.stageSketch(drawingData:previewData:altText:"Sketch created on Mac")`.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacSketchEditor.swift` (entire file, 146 lines).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-28 Document Scan Processing (OCR + PDF)
- Surface: Capture toolbar "Import Scan or PDF…"
- Summary: `MacDocumentScanProcessor` turns selected images into page image data, a combined PDF, and Vision OCR text, staged via `viewModel.stageScan`.
- Details:
  - OCR: `VNRecognizeTextRequest`, `.accurate` recognition, language correction on, per-page line joining, pages joined with blank lines; empty text → nil.
  - PDF: `PDFDocument` from `NSImage` pages; throws "The selected scan images could not be read." if no readable pages.
  - Runs OCR detached at userInitiated priority; security-scoped read per image URL; non-image selections from the same panel staged as generic files.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacDocumentScanProcessor.swift` (entire file, 72 lines); staging call in `MacCaptureWorkspaceView.chooseScan`.
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-29 Retry Inbox Draining & Folder-Permission Recovery
- Surface: Background (app runtime, activation, unlock); History "Needs Attention"; Capture error banner
- Summary: Failed capture deliveries accumulate in a durable inbox drained at launch, every 5 minutes, on activation, and on unlock; export-folder permission loss triggers an in-flow NSOpenPanel re-authorization.
- Details:
  - Drain triggers: main scene `.task` loop (300s), `applicationDidBecomeActive` (`retryFailedInbox`), `onAppear` (`processPendingInbox`), `usageTracker.hasUnlocked` transition, and after a queued-for-retry export (`pendingCaptureRetryHandler`).
  - Visibility: History "Retry N queued captures" row; Capture error banner inline retry; inbox location decision banner (Send Without / Always Without / Discard) for queued requests whose preset requires origin-time location, with a destructive confirmation before Discard.
  - Permission recovery: `prepareFlowForFileExportIfNeeded` / `prepareGlobalExportFolderIfNeeded` (MacRecorder) resolve per-flow/global bookmarks; stale or missing → titled NSOpenPanel ("Vox.md needs permission to save notes for the X Capture Preset.") creating a fresh `.withSecurityScope` bookmark persisted only to the folder fields of the stored flow (concurrent Settings edits preserved). History Reveal reports stale bookmarks with "Reauthorize the destination in Capture Presets."
  - Destination editor also detects stale bookmarks at edit time (`folderPermissionExpired`).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/VoxboardMacApp.swift` (drain triggers); `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` (permission recovery); `Voxboard Mac/MacRootView.swift` (`MacHistoryRevealError`); `Voxboard Mac/MacCaptureWorkspaceView.swift` (inline inbox location decision + destructive discard confirmation).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-30 Data Folder & Local Storage
- Surface: Vox.md menu + menu bar "Reveal Data Folder"
- Summary: Reveals the shared app container (`AppConstants.sharedContainerURL`) in Finder; recordings, job queue, transcripts, and capture library live in local app storage.
- Details:
  - Storage constants used throughout: `recordingsDirectoryURL` (recording files, meeting staging `meeting-*`, retained export audio, import copies), `recordingJobsDirectoryURL` (temp-dir fallback when unavailable), `captureLibraryURL` (destinations + entry templates; "Shared capture storage is unavailable." errors when nil), `captureDirectoryURL` (origin snapshots).
  - Recovery preservation: every failure path that could lose audio sets `lastRecoveryAudioURL` with a "recording was preserved" message; audio deleted only after durable delivery (exporter inbox, checkpointed audio, or successful legacy export).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/VoxboardMacApp.swift` (menu items); `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift` (storage + retention logic).
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped

### F-MC-31 App Shortcuts / Deep-Link Entrypoints
- Surface: `voxmd://` URL scheme; shared-defaults pending-open handoff; `handlesExternalEvents`
- Summary: Mac entry points for triggering capture: URL scheme hosts `capture`, `capture-request` (deep-link actions via `CaptureDeepLinkParser`), `listen`; and cross-app pending-open flags. No AppIntents-based App Shortcuts are defined in the in-scope Mac files (see Uncertainties).
- Details:
  - URL handling queues until the SwiftUI handler is configured (`pendingOpenURLs` in the app delegate).
  - Pending-open keys consumed on appear/activation: `pendingQuickCaptureOpenKey`, `...SourceKey` (CaptureSource), `...VoxIdKey`, `...InputKey` (CaptureRequestedInput → auto-invokes camera/files/scan/sketch/link/voice input).
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/VoxboardMacApp.swift` `handleURL`, `consumePendingQuickCaptureOpenIfNeeded`.
- Constraints: none beyond platform minimums
- Status: shipped (App Shortcuts proper: not present in scope)

### F-MC-32 Pause / Resume Microphone Recording
- Surface: Capture workspace recording status bar Pause/Resume button (hidden for meeting capture)
- Summary: `MacRecorder.pauseRecording()` / `resumeRecording()` / `toggleRecordingPause()` pause a live microphone recording and resume appending to the same file. Paused audio is excluded from the durable CAF journal, the live Speech preview feed, and the reported duration, so one finished note can be recorded in pieces.
- Details:
  - Backed by shared `AudioRecorder.pauseRecording()`/`resumeRecording()`: the input tap discards buffers while paused (journal writes, frame accounting, and the `audioBufferHandler` live-preview feed are gated under the recorder's lock), and the wall-clock time base shifts forward by the pause length on resume so `recordingDuration` excludes it.
  - `isRecordingPaused` is observable for the workspace status bar ("Paused MM:SS", pause ⇄ play icon); stop-while-paused resumes first so finalization state is clean.
  - Meeting capture (`MacMeetingCaptureCoordinator`, chunk-based ScreenCaptureKit) intentionally does not support pausing — the UI hides the toggle for meeting recordings.
- Constraints: not available during meeting capture.
- Evidence: `Voxboard Mac/MacRecorder.swift`; `Voxboard Mac/MacCaptureWorkspaceView.swift` `recordingStatusBar`; `Packages/VoxboardShared/Sources/VoxboardShared/AudioRecorder.swift` pause/resume + tap gating.
- Status: shipped

## Uncertainties

1. **App Shortcuts (AppIntents)**: The task mentions "Mac App Shortcuts"; no AppIntents/`AppShortcut` declarations exist in the 13 in-scope files. The Mac's external entry points are the `voxmd://` URL scheme and shared-defaults pending-open handoff (F-MC-31). App Shortcuts may exist elsewhere in the project (not in scope).
2. **Application Support fallback for unsigned dev builds**: Constantly referenced as `AppConstants.sharedContainerURL` / `captureLibraryURL` etc., which live in `VoxboardShared` (out of scope). The debug env override `VOXBOARD_SHARED_CONTAINER_OVERRIDE`/`AppConstants.debugSharedContainerOverrideEnvironmentKey` implies a container-override mechanism whose production fallback behavior (App Support vs. app group) could not be verified from these files.
3. **TXT/MD/JSON/YAML export formatting details**: Format rendering (e.g., `yamlUsesMarkdownExtension`, Obsidian Bases behavior) is implemented in shared `TranscriptFileExporter` / `ExportFileFormat`; only the UI options and delivery flow were verifiable here.
4. **RecordingQueueView internals** (per-job actions, transcription checkpoint UI) are a shared component; only the Mac retry wiring was in scope.
5. **Usage limit numbers** (15 min / 10 captures) are read from localized strings and `UsageTracker` display code; the authoritative constants live in shared code.
