## Documentation gap register

Derived from the `docs:` dispositions above and verified against all doc surfaces
(website docs, README, llms.txt, App Store metadata).

### Real gaps — shipped features without user-facing docs

**All closed 2026-08-22** — documented in `website/docs/index.html` and mirrored in `website/llms.txt`:

| ID | Feature | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| F-MC-16/17 | Mac Meeting Capture + dual-stem pipeline | Added `#mac-meeting` subsection to website docs `#mac` |
| F-IU-50 | Private Activity Stats screen | Added `#stats` subsection to `#history-settings` |
| F-IU-59 | OCR progress VoiceOver announcements | Added a11y note to `#capture-types` |

No open real gaps remain. New gaps should be added here as they are discovered.

### Intentionally undocumented (document the decision, not the feature)

| ID | Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| F-MC-08 | ⌃B keyboard hints (Mac) | Power-user easter egg; discovery is the feature |
| F-IC-23 | Review prompt policy | Internal growth mechanics |
| F-IC-26 | Geist design system | Internal implementation detail |
| F-CC-18 | Engine policy (Rust shadow routing) | Experimental M2 parity substrate |
| F-SH-49 | Smart Folders / Auto-Organize | Dormant off-by-default; llms.txt scope notes exclude from shipped docs |
| F-WT-18 | Watch DEBUG demo/screenshot modes | Debug-only |

### Legacy surfaces that docs must not present as current

- F-IU-41 / F-SH-41 — Legacy Voice File Export (kept for un-migrated presets only; docs already label it compatibility)
- F-IC-14 — Legacy IPC transcription server (superseded by persistent recorder segment flow)
- F-IU-52 — Recording flow screen (retained; primary path is inline recorder)

### Docs-coverage summary

- 270+ of 277 registry entries map to at least one docs surface.
- Website docs guide is current and thorough; the three known gaps were closed on 2026-08-22, so the shipped-feature docs coverage is complete as of that date.
