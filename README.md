Vox.md turns text, voice, links, photos, scans, sketches, and files into Markdown notes without sending captured content to a Vox.md service. Capture Presets control how each capture is processed, formatted, and delivered. A preset can create a note, update an existing file, write to a rolling note, insert beneath a heading, and manage metadata and attachments.

Capture from the main app, the Vox.md keyboard, Share Sheet, widgets, Control Center, Live Activities, Shortcuts, deep links, Mac keyboard shortcuts, or Apple Watch. Voice transcription runs on device with Apple Speech, Whisper, or Parakeet. Apple Intelligence processing also stays on device when it is available.

## At a glance

| Capability | What Vox.md does |
|---|---|
| Capture | Accepts Markdown, voice, links, photos, screenshots, files, document scans, journal-page OCR, and PencilKit sketches. |
| Process locally | Transcribes with Apple Speech or optional Whisper and Parakeet models. Supported devices can use Apple Intelligence for cleanup, titles, tags, checklists, meeting notes, and custom instructions. |
| Route with presets | Sends each capture to its own Obsidian vault or Files destination with templates, metadata, attachment rules, and new, existing, or rolling-note targets. |
| Capture anywhere | Works from iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, the iOS keyboard, Share Sheet, widgets, Control Center, Live Activities, Shortcuts, and deep links. |
| Recover safely | Saves drafts, attachments, and pending deliveries locally so failed writes can be retried without losing the capture or creating duplicates. |

## Features

### Universal Quick Capture
Capture typed Markdown, links, photos, selected screenshots, camera images, arbitrary files, document scans with on-device OCR and PDF generation, PencilKit sketches, journal pages extracted to Markdown, and voice attachments. Drafts and staged attachments are saved locally before export, so a permission or sync failure can be retried instead of losing the capture. With Automatic on supported iOS 26 devices, voice recordings show finalized and tentative Apple Speech text while recording. Whisper and Parakeet transcribe after recording stops. The audio remains usable if transcription is unavailable or fails.

The composer is a selection-aware Markdown editor with undo, bold, italic, headings, hashtags, tasks, bullets, links, wiki links, due-date tokens, timestamps, case transformations, and paste controls. The Capture Bar can be reordered and trimmed to the actions you use. Its independent **Current Location** action remains an explicit one-shot action that inserts a Google Maps link in the draft; it does not enable preset metadata.

Each Capture Preset owns one destination in an Obsidian vault or Files folder. Destinations can create new notes, target existing notes, or use daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly rolling notes. Presets also control append or prepend placement, heading insertion, multiline YAML or Markdown entry formatting, templates, attachment subfolders, retry protection, and resolved path previews.

### Capture Presets
A Capture Preset describes both the intent of a capture and where it belongs. The same Journal, Tasks, Meeting, or Inbox preset can accept typed Markdown, links, photos, files, OCR scans, sketches, and voice. Each preset includes its destination, placement, entry formatting, metadata, empty-composer prompt, optional on-device processing, and voice behavior. Voice processing can opt into anonymous, best-effort speaker labels for recordings and imported audio on iPhone, Watch transcript delivery, and Mac; the separate speaker model prepares on first use, and a failure preserves the plain transcript with a reason in History. Metadata can be note-level YAML frontmatter or queryable inline fields scoped to each rolling-note entry. A one-capture note, placement, or template override never mutates the preset.

Capture processing is opt-in for typed and mixed Markdown so existing presets never rewrite user-authored text unexpectedly. When enabled, text-bearing payloads keep their association with audio or scans, Apple Intelligence runs locally when available, and deterministic/original-text fallbacks keep delivery working offline. The exact processed request is persisted before writing so retries do not rerun AI against changed settings.

Quick Capture is available from the app, the Share Sheet, actionable Home Screen and Lock Screen widgets, Control Center, App Shortcuts for text, link, file, screenshot, and voice input, and preset-aware deep links. Capture history stores coarse preset, source, destination, and delivery metadata only. It does not store note text, URLs, coordinates, bookmarks, absolute paths, or attachment filenames. Pending and failed inbox items retain the content required for recovery. After delivery, Vox.md replaces each request with an ID-and-timestamp-only idempotency tombstone and sanitizes legacy completed requests on upgrade.

### Opt-In Preset Location
Current Location is off by default and configured separately for each Capture Preset. When enabled, Vox.md requests one origin-time location: at Send for iOS/iPadOS, Share Sheet, Shortcuts, deep-link/composer, and Mac captures, or when an immediate voice or Watch recording routed through normal Capture delivery stops. Widgets, controls, and keyboard-driven preset recordings use the same invocation-or-stop boundary. Watch **Recording Only** is a privacy-minimizing raw audio export with no Markdown location surface, so it does not request location. There is no continuous or background location tracking.

**Exact** is the default and retains the privacy-adjusted origin fix. **City** rounds latitude and longitude to two decimal places and omits point-of-interest labels. Entry prefixes, suffixes, and vault Markdown templates can use `{location}` to insert a clickable Google Maps link without writing additional metadata. **Write Location Metadata** is a separate opt-in. It can select and rename structured fields—coordinates, latitude, longitude, place, city, region, country, Apple Maps, Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, `geo:` URI, accuracy, timestamp, source, and Capture ID—or use validated advanced YAML for note frontmatter. Inline `key:: value` fields stay with an entry. Note frontmatter stores multiple locations in a collection keyed idempotently by Capture ID, preserving unrelated YAML and preventing retries from appending duplicates.

Place labels use Apple’s system reverse geocoder only when enabled metadata fields need them. It is free and needs no API key, but it may use the network and fails softly to coordinate-only metadata. The `{location}` token uses the preset’s available privacy-adjusted snapshot and is empty when Current Location is off or unavailable. Merely formatting an Apple Maps, Google Maps, or OpenStreetMap link does not contact that provider; opening a link discloses the same rounded or exact coordinates shown in the note to that provider.

If a one-shot request is unavailable, an interactive surface can retry, cancel, send once without location, or save **Always Send Without Location** for that preset; preset settings expose a reset. An unattended `Ask` request keeps its durable origin-time unavailable result until a person decides, and retries never acquire a later location. Pending and failed requests may therefore retain the privacy-adjusted snapshot or unavailable outcome needed for recovery. Completed Capture requests, Watch queue items, and Capture history are scrubbed to content-free tombstones or coarse records with no coordinates, labels, provider URLs, or location templates.

### Voice Keyboard
Add the Vox.md keyboard to iOS and dictate into any text field — Messages, Notes, Safari, or any app that accepts a keyboard. With Automatic on supported iOS 26 devices, finalized Apple Speech phrases stream into the active field while you speak; tentative words stay in the toolbar until Apple finalizes them. Whisper and Parakeet selections insert the completed transcript after recording stops. Parakeet users can optionally download the small on-device Voice Pause Detection companion to stop and transcribe keyboard segments after a configurable pause.

### On-Device Transcription
Speech recognition runs locally. On supported iOS 26 devices, Automatic uses Apple's `SpeechAnalyzer` and system-managed `SpeechTranscriber` assets. Whisper (`whisper.cpp`) and Core ML/FluidAudio-backed Parakeet models remain optional downloads and explicit overrides or fallbacks. No app-managed speech model weights ship in the app bundle. Audio, transcripts, capture drafts, and templates stay on the device.

### One-Shot Recording + Keyboard Listening
Tap **Start Recording** in the app, from Shortcuts, or from a widget to record one segment, process it locally, and automatically return the microphone session to idle. On iOS 26, the **Toggle Recording** shortcut starts and stops that same one-shot segment entirely in the background — bind it to the Apple Pencil squeeze, the Action Button, or run it from any shortcut, and a transient Live Activity in the Dynamic Island shows elapsed time with a Stop control while you stay in your current app (requires the Live Activities permission; configurable in Settings, and the shortcut opens the app instead when disabled). Keyboard users can still open Vox.md from the keyboard to start persistent listening, then mark recording segments from any text field.

### Apple Watch
Record voice notes from your wrist, pause and resume a recording, and choose which Capture Preset should handle it. Recordings stay in a durable Watch queue until they can sync to iPhone, where they can be processed, reassigned, retried, or discarded. A preset can run the normal local transcription and Markdown delivery flow or use Recording Only to keep the audio without transcribing it. The Watch widget provides quick access and reflects ready, recording, paused, syncing, and queued states.

### Model Picker
Automatic is the default on iOS and uses Apple Speech when the device and selected language support it. Users can optionally download and explicitly select Whisper Tiny, Base, Small, Medium, Large v3 Turbo, or Parakeet v2/v3. Downloaded models can also serve as Automatic's fallback.

### Transcript History
Every transcription is stored locally in the shared App Group container. Search raw text, cleaned text, titles, tags, and categories; edit saved transcripts; delete filtered selections safely; and share or export previous captures. Cross-process writes are coordinated so app and extension updates do not silently overwrite one another.

### Private Activity Stats
Stats shows lifetime recording and capture totals, recorded time, attachment counts, a seven-day activity chart, and a source breakdown for the app, keyboard, Share Sheet, widgets, Shortcuts, and Apple Watch. The ledger stays on device and excludes captured content, filenames, and destinations.

### File Export
Automatically save transcripts after each session as TXT, Markdown, or YAML. Choose a destination folder, use filename templates, append to a single file, render Markdown templates, and enable Obsidian-friendly frontmatter.

### Apple Intelligence Enrichment
On iOS 26+ devices and macOS 26+ Macs with Apple Intelligence, eligible Capture Presets can generate titles, tags, categories, cleaned-up text, checklists, meeting-note structure, and custom transformations — still locally on-device through Apple's Foundation Models framework.

Each request checks model readiness and its context budget. Known model failures use the existing local fallback without a second inference attempt. Captured text is never truncated to fit, and source links, code blocks, and speaker labels are protected when cleanup loses their structure.

On supported iOS/iPadOS/macOS 27 devices, Capture Presets also offer **Generate Image Alt Text**, off by default. With **Use Apple Intelligence** enabled, it describes newly attached photos, screenshots, and sketch previews on device so the draft can show the generated label before Send; Send still retries missing descriptions for deferred or queued captures, including when text Mode is **Keep Original**. Existing descriptions and original image files are preserved. Descriptions are saved before delivery and exported as standard Markdown alt text, so retries reuse the saved result. Unavailable models or failed descriptions keep the existing attachment and label. See the [implementation and validation record](docs/ios-27-on-device-intelligence-plan.md).

### Widgets & Live Activities
Open a durable Quick Capture draft or start and monitor recording from widgets, Live Activities, the lock screen, and Dynamic Island. The widget target shares state through the same private App Group container.

### macOS Companion
The Mac app has Capture, History, and Settings workspaces plus menu-bar operation. Record or import audio and video, choose Apple Speech, Whisper, or Parakeet, manage complete Capture Presets, browse transcript history, and export TXT, Markdown, JSON, or YAML with optional audio attachments. Global shortcuts can start a temporary transcription or run a specific preset from anywhere while Vox.md is open. Mac App Shortcuts also expose text, link, file, screenshot, voice, and Quick Capture actions. Apple Intelligence enrichment is available on capable Macs running macOS 26 or later.

The Mac drains the same durable retry inbox as iOS and can reroute failed captures after folder permissions change. It uses the shared model, history, and export stack with an Application Support fallback for unsigned development builds.

## Pricing

Vox.md includes **15 minutes of free transcription** and **10 successful Capture deliveries** so you can test the full flow. Failed writes and retries do not consume a Capture; voice transcripts routed to Markdown use only the transcription allowance.

Unlimited transcription and Capture are a one-time **$9.99** unlock. No subscription, no renewal, no ads. Users who bought the original paid app build are automatically grandfathered into unlimited access. The successful-Capture count is stored only in local app data, never in Keychain; removing that data starts a fresh free allowance.

## Build Targets

| Target | Bundle ID | Platform |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Voxboard | `bontecou.Voxboard` | iOS / iPadOS |
| Voxboard Keyboard | `bontecou.Voxboard.Voxboard-Keyboard` | iOS keyboard extension |
| Voxboard WidgetExtension | `bontecou.Voxboard.Voxboard-Widget` | iOS widgets / Live Activities / controls |
| Voxboard Share Extension | `bontecou.Voxboard.ShareExtension` | iOS share sheet |
| Voxboard Watch | `bontecou.Voxboard.watchkitapp` | watchOS app |
| Voxboard Watch WidgetExtension | `bontecou.Voxboard.watchkitapp.Widget` | watchOS widgets |
| Voxboard Mac | `bontecou.Voxboard` | macOS companion app |

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodyBontecou/Voxboard.git
   cd Voxboard
   ```
2. Open `Voxboard.xcodeproj` in Xcode 26.2+.
3. Select the **Voxboard** scheme for iOS and iPadOS, **Voxboard Mac** for macOS, or **Voxboard Watch** for watchOS.
4. Set your development team for all targets.
5. Configure the App Group entitlement (`group.bontecou.Voxboard`) for your team or replace it with your own group ID in the targets and `AppConstants.swift`.
6. Build and run on a physical device. Keyboard, microphone, background audio, and model performance are best tested on hardware.

### Required Permissions

The app requests the following permissions/settings at runtime:

- **Microphone** — records speech for local transcription or a user-requested Capture voice attachment.
- **Camera / selected photos** — used only when explicitly adding local capture media, selected screenshots, or scans.
- **Location When In Use** — requested only for the independent one-shot map-link action or when an opted-in Capture Preset needs its one origin-time location; no continuous or background tracking.
- **Keyboard Full Access** — required by iOS for the keyboard extension to access the shared container and microphone workflow.
- **Background Audio** — keeps the listening session alive while you switch apps.

### Entitlements

- App Groups (`group.bontecou.Voxboard`) — shared models, transcripts, settings, durable capture inbox data, and IPC between the app, keyboard, widgets, and share extension.
- Background Modes: Audio — persistent listening while moving between apps.
- Live Activities — lock screen and Dynamic Island controls.

## URL Scheme

The app registers the `voxboard://` URL scheme:

- `voxboard://listen` — opens Vox.md and starts the keyboard launch/listening flow.
- `voxboard://record` — legacy keyboard record entry point, redirected to listening mode.
- `voxboard://widget-record` — legacy widget entry point for starting a recording preset.
- `voxboard://capture` — opens the durable Quick Capture composer.
- `voxboard://capture?action=photos|screenshots|camera|files|link|scan|sketch|voice` — opens the composer and requests that exact local input.
- `voxboard://capture?preset=...&text=...&url=...` — selects a Capture Preset, validates bounded input, and opens an incoming draft. Legacy `vox=` and `destination=` parameters remain accepted for existing links.
- `voxboard://capture-request?id=...` — claims an App Group inbox request from Shortcuts/share sheet.
