// MARK: - Toggle Recording Intent

/// Toggles a Vox.md recording in place — without switching apps.
///
/// Built for hardware triggers (Apple Pencil squeeze, Action Button) and any
/// Shortcut: the first run starts a one-shot recording segment while the user
/// stays in their current app (waking Vox.md in the background when needed);
/// the next run stops it.
///
/// iOS 26+ only: conforming to `AudioRecordingIntent` is what allows the app
/// to activate the microphone from a background launch. Without that blessing
/// `AVAudioEngine.start()` fails when the system wakes the app for the intent,
/// leaving a stale "Microphone error" and no recording. On older systems the
/// legacy open-and-record shortcut remains the supported path; the action is
/// availability-gated out of the Shortcuts library below iOS 26.
///
/// When in-place recording still cannot start — free-tier limit reached, mic
/// permission missing, or the engine failing — the intent chains to the
/// open-and-record intent so the user still gets their recording.
